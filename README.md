# BudgetTracker

## User Story

- As an avid traveler, I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When the user inputs an expense or deposit, then they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit.
- When the user reestablishes an internet connection, then the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated.
